<p>Continuing from the <a href="./prototyping-hack-game1.html">last post</a> with prototyping a game based on hacking networks and gaining territory.</p>

<p>The next step of prototyping is the things that the player controls the board with. Since this is going to be (at least in my head for now) a hacking culture related game, it seemed appropriate to call these trojans.</p>
<p>The way I want this game to work is you have some sort of attack units that follow a single set of instructions. The fun (I think) will come from the player making a set of different units that do different things, and combining their use to form interesting strategies.</p>
<p>Here you see me choosing a particular cell, and when I let the game update the trojan propagates with a specific set of instructions I gave it. In this case I said to infect the top and bottom cell, then infect the right cell, repeating this forever.</p>
<p>Already I can see there are a couple of management problems I will have technically. Right now I’m implementing this by creating new trojans for the cells that are infected, but you can see there is a possibility of a lot of overlap. Maybe next time I will move this logic to be contained within the trojan, and just keep track of the tiles it is currently on.</p>
<h2 id="making-this-into-a-game">Making This Into a Game</h2>
<p>Already I can see the possibility for a bit of the thinking kind of fun. Originally when I envisioned this I was seeing a battle of territory between two adversaries, each using their respective techniques to take over, but there are a lot of other areas that can be changed to possibly add more fun. Simple off the top of my head things include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a limit to how much a trojan can propagate</li>
<li>Add a cool down rate to how fast a trojan propagates based on the directions it is given</li>
<li>Give the player constrained parameters to work with in the creation/usage of trojans</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="next-up-on-the-plate">Next up on the Plate</h2>
<p>Next time I will probably do a little optimization in how propagation works, and then work out a simple way to create trojans in the GUI, seeing how things play out.</p>
