<p>It seems like all my work with regards to the one game a month challenge gets delayed. In this post, I will be discussing the platformer I worked on in the first month of the challenge. Since this is one game that I did not end up finishing, I will be merely posting my remarks in making it. If you aren’t familiar with this challenge, please look at my <a href="./starting-onegame-this-year.html">previous post</a></p>

<h2 id="various-developer-troubles">Various Developer Troubles</h2>
<p>One of the things I enjoy about making games is that they are a great teaching tool about programming in general. As I go through making a game I find out the areas in which I am lacking as a developer and attempt to alleviate them a little. This game in particular made me realize a few areas I needed more work on.</p>
<p>One of my weaknesses as a developer is that I tend to jump into the code and work my way through the various features I am expected to have done. On small well defined projects this is not really a problem, but with big projects (like game making!) this problem rears its ugly head. What ended up happening for this project is that I had to refactor my code a few times before it got to a state where I could continue.</p>
<p>The other problem I ran into was a different form of inexperience. When I was writing my code I had a great amount of difficulty seperating out the different things I wanted the platformer to have. In particular, the player’s state was difficult for me to express. The things I wanted the player to do was fairly simple, just move and jump. When I got to writing it though there were a ton of edge cases I had to check. What if I tried jumping while in the air? How did movement work when the player is falling? What ended up happening is that I expressed this in a single monolithic player class. Later, I learned of the state machine pattern and my eyes were opened. That pattern gives a nice concise way of seperating these concerns out. This was yet another refactor to add to my code.</p>

<h2 id="physics-fun">Physics Fun</h2>
<p>The other interesting bit was working with the physics engine. The physics engine made movement pretty easy, but somethings were a little interesting to figure out. When it came to movement I had a difficult time expressing the movement how I wanted it in terms of physical properties. I tried doing various forms of friction and acceleration/forces, but in the end I made it easier on myself and just set the friction fairly high and when the player was moved to set them to a constant velocity. I had the same difficulties with jumping, but that was easy to figure out once I found a way to do the normal movement.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While those were my more concrete problems, I think the problem in general was that I chose a project that was too big a scope for me to do. Before my next projects I’ll be trying to keep the scope much lower.</p>
