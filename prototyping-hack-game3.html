<p>Continuing from the <a href="./prototyping-hack-game2.html">last post</a> with prototyping a game based on hacking networks and gaining territory.</p>

<p>Today was spent refactoring how the trojan code worked. Before I had it so that a new trojan object was created for each cell that it infected. It became immediately apparent that this was a very poor implementation on my part however, as things slowed down to a crawl quickly. So instead, I have the trojan maintain control of where it spreads, and moved drawing for the trojans into that module.</p>
<p>Along with that I also made a trivial implementation of a set made to contain points. This proves very helpful as a quicker way to test if a tile exists at certain points, or if the trojan can move to a new spot.</p>
<p>After this was all working somewhat ok, I started work on differentiating trojans. To start off, I made a computer player type and a human player type. There is no special logic made for when these two trojans interact though, that will be worked on next time.</p>
<h2 id="implementing-a-point-set">Implementing a Point set</h2>
<p>One of the interesting things about Lua (the language Löve2D uses) is its heavy use of the table (map) data structure. Usually you can easily implement a set using a table, by using the the keys part of the table as where you store your data. This proves difficult in Lua though, due to the fact that if I use a <code>Point</code> table as key for another table, it uses the reference address to determine equality of the tables. This means I couldn’t do this:</p>
<pre><code>set = {}

pt1 = {x=1,y=2}

set[pt1] = true
print(set[pt1]) --true


pt2 = {x=1, y=2} --make a different table
print(set[pt2]) --nil, not the expected true</code></pre>
<p>So for the <code>Point</code> set I had to implement a 2 layer set. The first layer uses the x value of the point as a key, and a set that uses the y value in that slot. Doing this made it so I could use different <code>Point</code> objects and still be able to use them for the <code>Point</code> sets I made.</p>
<p>Do not take this to mean that other languages would not have this problem if I were implementing a set type. It’s mainly due to the fact that Lua leaves a lot of things to be implemented by the user.</p>
